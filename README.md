Home Operations Central Utility Server

After using several consumer-oriented home automation products, and always needing to write a bunch of extra scripts and programs to get them to do exactly what I want, I am creating my own.

* distributed audio system (multi-room capability via bluetooth speakers, raspberry pi audio host)
* neopixel control (arduino, rpi, pixlight16, dmxking)
* sACN, DMX512
* scripting (javascript)
* Philips Hue (including Hue Entertainment)
* IFTTT
* Projector and screen control
* Pandora, Spotify integration
